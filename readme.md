## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **RGB / RGBA (8 bpc) Support** | Recognizes both 3-channel (RGB) and 4-channel (RGBA) formats; automatically generates opaque alpha if missing |
| **Perfect Group Structure Restoration** | Interprets PSD `lsct` (Section Divider) Types 0-3 â†’ Converts to Aseprite folders with `Layer.isGroup = true` |
| **PackBits RLE Decompression** | Implements only the compression used by the export script, reducing complexity while increasing speed |
| **UTF-8 Safe Name Handling** | Converts `luni` (UTF-16BE) layer names â†’ UTF-8, automatically replaces invalid bytes to prevent crashes |
| **CLI & GUI Support** | Both Aseprite UI dialog and `aseprite -b -script ... --filename=â€¦` command-line usage |
| **Automatic Debug Logging** | Generates `PSD Import Debug Log.txt` in the same folder for layer tree and error tracking |

## Requirements

* **Aseprite â‰¥ 1.2.10-beta3** (API v1 or higher)
* Lua 5.3 (built-in)
* Tested on: Windows 10 / macOS 13 / Ubuntu 22.04

## Installation

1. Copy **`import from psd.lua`** to:  
   `Aseprite â–¶ Edit â–¶ Preferences â–¶ Scripts â–¶ Open Folderâ€¦`
2. Restart Aseprite or use **`Scripts â–¶ Reload`**
3. If you see **`File â–¶ Scripts â–¶ PSD â†’ Aseprite Importâ€¦`** in the menu, installation is complete

---

## Usage

### 1) GUI Mode

1. Select **Scripts â–¶ PSD â†’ Aseprite Importâ€¦**
2. Choose your `.psd` file â†’ Click **Import**
3. The imported sprite will open in a new tab

```

This is useful for batch converting multiple PSD files in scripts.

## Support Coverage / Limitations

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| 8 bpc Bit Depth | âœ” |
| RGB Color Mode | âœ” |
| Alpha Channel (-1) | âœ” (Auto-opaque if missing) |
| Group (Folder) Hierarchy | âœ” |
| Layer Masks | âœ– Ignored |

## Known Issues

- **Large PSD files (hundreds of MB)**: Memory usage may increase significantly when PackBits compression is absent or when decompressed data is very large.

- **Surrogate pairs (U+10000+)**: Rarely used in PSD spec, but will be replaced with "?" if encountered.

---

## Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Import speed optimization using direct `image.bytes` allocation
- [ ] Multi-frame (animation) support  
- [ ] Layer mask / adjustment layer parser
- [ ] 16 bpc PSD beta support
